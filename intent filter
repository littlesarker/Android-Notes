///*****let's assume that you have an Activity that needs to launch an email client and sends an email using your Android device.
For this purpose, your Activity would send an ACTION_SEND along with appropriate chooser,
to the Android Intent Resolver. The specified chooser gives the proper interface fo
 the user to pick how to send your email data. *\\\\


Intent email = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND, Uri.parse("mailto:"));
email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, recipients);
email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject.getText().toString());
email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, body.getText().toString());
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(email, "Choose an email client from..."));



////*****  For example, assume that you have an Activity that needs to open URL in a web browser on your Android device. For this purpose,
your Activity will send ACTION_WEB_SEARCH Intent to the Android Intent Resolver to open given URL in the web browser. The Intent Resolver 
parses through a list of Activities and chooses the one that would best match your Intent, 
in this case, the Web Browser Activity. The Intent Resolver then passes your web page to the web browser and starts the Web Browser Activity

String q = "tutorialspoint";
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH );
intent.putExtra(SearchManager.QUERY, q);
startActivity(intent);
